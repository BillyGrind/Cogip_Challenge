*Alexandra participated in the creation of the database, and its improvement throughout the project.
She also created the sorting systems and search engine for the data tables presented on the Invoices / Contacts / Companies pages.*

*Her participation in the creation of the server queries, enabled the display of the details of the various data mentioned above.*

*It took a lot of coffee to feed Alex energy...*

*Steve's role was to lead the team as project manager. Multi-hatted, he was heavily involved in the back end of the project and in debugging in general, while at the same time unblocking certain situations on the front end.*

*The different parts of the exercise were cut out on a [trello](https://trello.com/b/Fgo9zR21/cogip) which he maintained throughout the 10 days of development.* 

*On the back side, he set up the routing, the databases, the pagination system, the breadcrumb trail, the htaccss files, the dashboard and his CRUD.*


**Front-end** :

*Anthony was at the forefront of this project, managing almost the entire design. Having worked mainly with Sass, he also wrote a few small client-side scripts in native JavaScript.*

*In particular, he was responsible for the hamburger menu and general navigation. As well as the overall responsive look of the various pages presented.*

*A [mokup](https://www.figma.com/file/PS5hPdhywkRfxreITOYwba/Cogip?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=ZxSZnTCef5YIH6fT-0) figma was provided for integration.*
